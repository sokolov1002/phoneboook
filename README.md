This is another small python OOP project.

To make the long story short - the user can add, search, show, update (change name, number and email) and delete records in a phonebook. 

I used classes for the phonebook and for the records in it. Simple as that. 

This simple program was inspired from an old code of mine, made without using OOP, which I decided to change as a part of my studying of python with OOP.
